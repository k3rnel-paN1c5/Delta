# GitHub Action for Compiling LaTeX Document
#
# This workflow will be triggered on every push to the 'main' branch.
# It checks out the repository's code, compiles the specified LaTeX file,
# and then uploads the resulting PDF as a build artifact.

# Controls when the workflow will run

  # Triggers the workflow on push events but only for the main branch
  push:

jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build_latex"

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository's code
      # This action checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it.
