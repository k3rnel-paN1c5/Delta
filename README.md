# Enhancing Real-Time Depth Estimation via Knowledge Distillation

This repository contains the code for the project "Enhancing Real-Time Depth Estimation via Knowledge Distillation". The project is currently under development.

## üìù Introduction

Depth estimation is a crucial task in computer vision with applications in autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. While large deep learning models for depth estimation achieve high accuracy, their computational requirements limit their use on resource-constrained devices like mobile phones. This project utilizes **Knowledge Distillation (KD)** to transfer knowledge from a large, high-performing "teacher" model to a smaller, more efficient "student" model. The goal is to achieve near-teacher-level performance with significantly lower computational cost, enabling real-time depth estimation on a wider range of hardware.

## üéØ Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:
1.  **Implement a Teacher Model**: Utilize a state-of-the-art pretrained model for monocular depth estimation.
2.  **Design a Student Model**: Create a lightweight and fast model suitable for real-time inference on devices with limited resources.
3.  **Apply Knowledge Distillation**: Train the student model using KD techniques to retain the teacher's accuracy.
4.  **Evaluate Performance**: Compare the student model's performance and efficiency (FPS, memory usage) against the teacher model and a baseline student model trained without distillation.
5.  **Demonstrate Real-Time Inference**: Showcase the distilled model's real-time capabilities using a live or recorded camera feed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

The project follows these steps:

1.  **Teacher Model Selection**: A high-performing, pretrained depth estimation network like MiDaS or a Transformer-based model is used.
2.  **Student Model Design**: A smaller, efficient CNN architecture is designed, potentially using techniques like skip connections or depthwise separable convolutions to minimize parameters.
3.  **Distillation Framework**: The student model is trained using a combination of a standard depth regression loss (L1 or L2) and a distillation loss that measures the similarity between the student's and teacher's outputs.
4.  **Training**: The models are trained on a public dataset such as KITTI (for outdoor scenes) or NYU Depth v2 (for indoor scenes). Data augmentation techniques are applied to improve generalization.
5.  **Evaluation**: The models are evaluated using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Absolute Relative Error.

## üìà Expected Outcomes

* **Reduced Model Size**: The student model is expected to be significantly smaller than the teacher model (e.g., 10-30% of the parameters).
* **Comparable Accuracy**: The student model aims to achieve a depth estimation error within 5-10% of the teacher's accuracy.
* **Real-Time Inference**: The student model should achieve a higher inference speed (FPS) compared to the teacher model.
* **Demonstration**: A clear demonstration of how knowledge distillation can bridge the gap between high accuracy and efficient deployment in depth estimation tasks.
