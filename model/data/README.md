# Data for Training.
The images I used for training the model are not uploaded to github.

My kind friends provided pictures they took with their own moble camera for the sake of this project to succeed.

You can use any raw unlabeled images, put them in `model/data/raw` directory, and run the `name_Images.sh` script.

``` bash
    ./data/name_Images.sh ./data/raw
```
